 Purpose of this project creating a general boilerplate for epub creation.
 Unfortunately creating epubs for multiple reader's can be painful. The
 Epub CSS Starter Kit trying to support the main three platform of ebook
 readers. 
 
 How to support ebook-reader platform's by that project?
 What platform is the focus of this effort? Oddly enough, the .mobi format for Kindle, is the least common denominator that we want to get working. Given that it has 70% of the market, it makes sense to put the effort there. Every effort has been made so that epubs using this css will generate clean mobi's with kindlegen.

The other platforms of significance are nook and ibooks, in that order, finally
other platforms.

Unfortunately some devices and softwares not support epub3 standard.
